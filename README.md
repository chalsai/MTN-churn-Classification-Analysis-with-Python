# MTN-churn-Classification-Analysis-with-Python


# Background and Problem Statement

You work as a Data Scientist for MTN Africa, a leading Telecommunications Company in
Africa. In an effort to understand the behaviour of the company's customers, you are
tasked to analyze relevant customer data and develop a solution that will help determine
whether a customer will churn. Use the provided dataset to implement your solution. In
addition, you will be expected to help relevant stakeholders understand the potential of
your developed solution.

You will be required to go through the following stages:

● Defining the Research Question

● Data Importation

● Data Exploration

● Data Cleaning

● Data Analysis (Univariate and Bivariate)

● Data Preparation

● Data Modeling

● Model Evaluation

● Challenging your Solution

● Recommendations / Conclusion

You can use the following guideline notebook 


# Metric for Success
To create a classification model with at least 80% accuracy score


# Summary of Findings


- Among the five classification models used Decision Tree emerged as one with the highest accuracy score

- Customers who made more than 3 calls reported high churn rates, meaning customer service could not have resolved these customers' complaints.

- Customers without international plans were more likely to churn as compared to those without.

# Recommendations

- MTN should ensure customer issues are resolved fast to avoid repear callers.

- identify the root cause for high churn rate from customers without international plans, and resolve the same

- They should use Decision Tree classifier to predict whether a customer will churn or not.
